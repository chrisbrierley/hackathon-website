The [MOAP]({% link about.md %}) CMIP6 Hackathon is a 3-day
hackathon event, organised by the University of Bristol's [Jean Golding
Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/) and [Cabot
Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cabot/). Over the course of the event,
teams of academic researchers from across the UK will work on research questions
set by the MOAP partners related to earth-system science and [CMIP6
data](https://esgf-index1.ceda.ac.uk/projects/cmip6-ceda/). We encourage
contributions from early career researchers, including PhDs and Postdocs.

## Logistics

The event will take place virtually, using a combination of **video
conferencing** (e.g. Teams/Zoom) for meetings and seminars, and **discussion
forums** (e.g. Slack/Discord) for ongoing comms. Data holding and analysis will
take place on [JASMIN](https://www.jasmin.ac.uk/), the UK's data analysis
facility for environmental science, which also provides a copy of the CMIP6
data.

## Outputs

By the end of the event, we  hope to have two or three core figures per research
question, that show new insight into the field, using CMIP6 data. The figures
will form the basis of material for [COP26](https://ukcop26.org/), and for
peer-reviewed publication.
