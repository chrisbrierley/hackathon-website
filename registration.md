This virtual event will require some commitment prior to and including the
Hackathon Event which will take part from 2â€“4 June 2021.

Researchers can sign up to [a range of topics]({% link projects.md %}), from ...
to ... Teams will be led by researchers from a range of disciplines at the Met
Office's partner universities, but participating researchers can be from any UK
academic institution.

The Hackathon will provide a prime opportunity for researchers to build on their
academic networks and develop their research skills within a highly
collaborative environment. In addition to showcasing key outputs at COP26 in
Glasgow this November, we hope that the research produced could lead to future
publications and collaborations.

We are looking for enthusiastic and dedicated researchers who already have
experience with analysing climate model data. Technical support and guidance
will be provided but we expect all applicants to have prior knowledge of
scientific programming.

We will supply each researcher with a temporary hackathon account on the JASMIN
data analysis facility, which will give then access to a Python 3 notebook
environment and a variety of relevant datasets, for which we can provide
technical support and guidance. Researchers (especially those with existing
JASMIN accounts) may be able to use other programming languages and tools,
however we will only be able to provide limited support for these.
